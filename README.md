# PageRank

First, the program builds an URLs graph (as adjacency list) using a crawler (implementation - crawler.py).

The graph:

Root = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank.

Each node has 10 childs (max).

Depth = 3.





When crawler finished, the program runs my implementation of PageRank algorithm.
